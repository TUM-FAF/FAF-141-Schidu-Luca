## Deployment :
- I used *heroku* for deploynment. This is a free cloud computing site that allows you to publish your application onlie so that everyone can use it. You also can configure a database there for the project. You can check the application at [this link](http://afternoon-meadow-57267.herokuapp.com)  username : *utm*, password: *123*


# Conclusion : 
In this laboratory work I've a web application using a new technology for me. That was a great experience. NodeJs is a very powerfull tool if you want to quickly make a server. AngularJs also is quite powerful framework for front-end development. It's really great that now with a single language *Javascript* you can make a functional application with back and front-end. I've also learned how to deploy the projects on heroku to be visible to the whole world.
